# 🖥️ Multi-Host Service Monitor Dashboard

A self-hosted web dashboard to monitor and control `systemd` services across multiple Linux hosts using SSH.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 View, filter, and sort `systemctl` services
- 🟢 Restart / Stop / Start any service with one click
- 🔁 Auto-refresh with update timestamp
- ➕ Add new machines directly from the web interface
- ✅ SSH key-based login generation from the browser
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The dashboard **always includes a built-in `LOCAL` tab** for the host it's running on.
- External systems are defined in `nodes.json`.
- If `nodes.json` is empty or missing, the dashboard still works with `LOCAL` only.
- The **`+ New Machine` tab** allows adding other systems by IP, username, port, and password.
    - It will generate an SSH key and copy it using the provided password (if needed).
    - Your `nodes.json` file is updated automatically.
